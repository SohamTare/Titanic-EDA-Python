# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset
to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

## Dataset
- Source: Titanic passenger dataset
- Rows: 891
- Columns: 12

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males
- First-class passengers survived more than lower classes
- Children had better survival chances
- Age and passenger class significantly influenced survival
